# Explicit wait

# An explicit wait is a code you define to wait for a certain condition to occur before proceeding further in the code.
# Explicit waits are achieved by using webdriverWait class in combination with expected_conditions.

# This waits up to 10 seconds before throwing a TimeoutException unless it finds the element to return within 10
# seconds. WebDriverWait by default calls the ExpectedCondition every 500 milliseconds until it returns successfully.

# Expected Conditions â€“
# There are some common conditions that are frequently of use when automating web browsers. For example,
# presence_of_element_located, title_is, ad so on:

# title_is
# title_contains
# presence_of_element_located
# visibility_of_element_located
# visibility_of
# presence_of_all_elements_located
# element_located_to_be_selected
# element_selection_state_to_be
# element_located_selection_state_to_be
# alert_is_present
# etc.
