<h1><mark>If you want the background image to cover the entire element, you can set the background-size property to cover.
    Also, to make sure the entire element is always covered, set the background-attachment property to fixed.This way,
    the background image will cover the entire element, with no stretching (the image will keep its original
    proportions): <br>
